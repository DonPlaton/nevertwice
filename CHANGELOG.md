## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-09

A hostile-critique hardening round: every finding below was verified by execution before fixing,
and each fix carries a regression test.

### Added
- **Token-savings counter** (`nevertwice stats`, `python -m nevertwice.stats`): a best-effort ledger
  of what the active layer bought - tokens saved vs re-injecting the whole store each turn, guard
  fires, counterfactuals - shown as a terminal panel with a 14-day activity sparkline, a dashboard
  card, and a one-line digest summary. Stdlib, atomic, hot-path-safe (a failure here can never
  affect the recall it measures).
- **Universal guard pack** (`NEVERTWICE_GUARD_PACK=1` or `python -m nevertwice.guards pack`):
  11 high-precision classic pitfalls that warn from the first session with no model and no
  history. Advisory-only, never promotes to blocking, self-retires like any guard.
- Benchmark infographic in the README; a measured **Speed** section in docs/BENCHMARKS.md with
  `research/latency_bench.py` to reproduce it anywhere.
- Community surface: CODE_OF_CONDUCT, issue/PR templates, ROADMAP, docs and examples indexes.
- `env_int`/`env_float`: a mistyped numeric env var now degrades to the default with a warning
  instead of crashing the import.

### Fixed
- Idle SessionStart no longer pays the LLM liveness probe: 2,188 ms -> 80 ms measured. Every
  hook process sheds two lazy imports: PreToolUse end-to-end 146 -> 76-85 ms.
- AGENTS.md refresh crashed on a Windows path in the project card (regex replacement template).
- 3 of the 12 MCP tools were advertised but not dispatchable (memory_why, memory_guard_feedback,
  memory_anticipate_feedback); a parity test now pins TOOLS == dispatch.
- The git merge driver silently dropped block-style YAML lists (as written by Obsidian's
  Properties panel); that shape now surfaces as a real conflict instead of losing tags.
- The ReDoS filter is now a shape-agnostic subprocess probe with a hard 0.6s timeout and fails
  closed; a static denylist had missed several catastrophic patterns across review rounds
  (including a paren-less `a+a+...b` and the bounded `(a{1,2}){38}`).
- Calibrated score fusion no longer sinks a lone hit to the bottom of the ranking (a single-signal
  z-score collapsed to zero); one relevant note now ranks correctly in default retrieval.
- Recall survives a malformed note whose frontmatter triggers a RecursionError (now caught with the
  other parse errors instead of aborting the sweep).
- `embed_index` takes the vault lock, so a rebuild can no longer race consolidation's cache writes;
  consolidation no longer crashes on a cached recurrence float; `bootstrap --force` no longer erases
  a project's Context history.
- `.docx` was the only size-capped document format; the cap now guards every format and stdin.
- install.py could claim a foreign script that happened to be named memory_hook.py.
- Larger, more readable dashboard type; the dashboard also builds from one vault scan (was three).
- Two research figures baked the pre-rename name into their title; regenerated. The post-retrieval
  infographic's footer line overlapped the bottom cards; canvas raised so it clears them.

### Changed
- The tagline leads with the active layer: *"Proactive, local-first memory for AI coding agents -
  it acts before your agent repeats a mistake."* Reader-facing docs no longer carry internal
  tracking codes; the recall-leanness numbers read as one honest range across the tour and the
  infographic.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-04

The project was **renamed from Anamnesis to Nevertwice**, and the headline feature became Active
Memory: memory that acts on a past mistake instead of only recalling text.

### Renamed (nothing breaks for a release)
- Repo, package, and store are now `nevertwice`. The old GitHub URL 301-redirects; stars and forks
  carried over.
- `ANAMNESIS_*` and `CLAUDE_MEMORY_*` environment variables are bridged to `NEVERTWICE_*`
  automatically, so an existing config keeps working.
- An existing `~/.anamnesis` store is used in place; new installs create `~/.nevertwice`. Your data
  is never moved silently.
- The `anamnesis-search` / `-remember` / `-mcp` console commands remain as aliases.

### Added
- **Active Memory.** Guards compile a past mistake into an executable check that fires *before* the
  agent repeats it, at zero context tokens until it fires (Popperian lifecycle: advisory until
  corroborated, self-retiring on false positives, always overridable). Wired into the Claude Code
  PreToolUse hot path. Plus anticipation (trajectory-resemblance warnings) and counterfactual
  (`what breaks if I change X?` from an induced causal graph).
- **12-tool MCP server** (was 9): added `memory_why`, `memory_guard_feedback`, and
  `memory_anticipate_feedback`, so MCP-only agents (Cursor, Cline, Zed, Claude Desktop) can train
  guards, not only read them.
- **Cross-machine sync that merges.** A structured git merge driver auto-resolves concurrent edits
  to the same note (recurrence takes the max, a retirement wins, tags union) and leaves honest
  conflict markers on a genuine divergence. Verified end to end through real git.
- **Self-contained HTML dashboard** (`python -m nevertwice.dashboard`): the whole store rendered
  into one offline file, no server.
- A comparison row and honest write-up for the Hindsight memory system.

### Changed
- README leads with the moat (plain files you own, plus memory that acts) and the measured
  guard result, with the token-economy number kept in context rather than as a headline.
- Repo layout: tests and the research harnesses moved out of the shipped package, so a
  `pip install` gets runtime code only.
- CI runs the product suite on Python 3.10-3.14 across Linux, macOS, and Windows; the research
  harnesses run on a current Python.

### Fixed
- Two critical merge-driver bugs (a non-existent module path in the driver registration, and a
  conflict that could silently drop one side on rebase) plus ~20 correctness and hardening fixes
  from two adversarial review rounds and a five-advisor council review.
- Secret redaction now also covers the embeddings-cache and cloud-embedder path.
- A regex character class that emitted a Python 3.14 `FutureWarning` and had stopped stripping
  en/em dashes.
- All 162 open code-scanning alerts resolved (real fixes; a few documented policy exclusions).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06

### Added
- Opt-in **Brain layer** (`NEVERTWICE_PROFILE=research` or `general`): the same captured sessions
  self-wire into a knowledge graph of typed entities (paper, method, dataset, ...) with per-entity
  cards, an evolution timeline, and graph-centrality salience. Pull-only, so the token-bounded hot
  path is byte-for-byte unchanged when it is off (the default).
- A SQLite scale-tier keeps entity queries single-digit-millisecond into thousands of notes.

### Invariants (enforced by tests)
- Hot-path injection is byte-for-byte unchanged with the Brain layer off.
- Brain notes are pull-only, never in the default injection set.
- `LOCAL_ONLY` projects and agents never reach the cloud.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06

Initial public release: local-first, agent-agnostic long-term memory as plain Markdown under git.
Hybrid retrieval (local `bge-m3` embeddings fused with BM25, calibrated abstention), write-time
supersession so contradictions do not pile up, capture for Claude Code (hooks) and any agent
(MCP / watch daemon / Python API / LangChain / LlamaIndex). On LongMemEval-oracle with one shared
local embedder, calibrated fusion reached R@5 0.80 against Mem0 0.76, with the harness and the
negative results published.
