All notable changes to Nevertwice. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com);
versions are [semantic](https://semver.org). Dates are UTC.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-04

The project was **renamed from Anamnesis to Nevertwice**, and the headline feature became Active
Memory: memory that acts on a past mistake instead of only recalling text.

### Renamed (nothing breaks for a release)
- Repo, package, and store are now `nevertwice`. The old GitHub URL 301-redirects; stars and forks
  carried over.
- `ANAMNESIS_*` and `CLAUDE_MEMORY_*` environment variables are bridged to `NEVERTWICE_*`
  automatically, so an existing config keeps working.
- An existing `~/.anamnesis` store is used in place; new installs create `~/.nevertwice`. Your data
  is never moved silently.
- The `anamnesis-search` / `-remember` / `-mcp` console commands remain as aliases.

### Added
- **Active Memory.** Guards compile a past mistake into an executable check that fires *before* the
  agent repeats it, at zero context tokens until it fires (Popperian lifecycle: advisory until
  corroborated, self-retiring on false positives, always overridable). Wired into the Claude Code
  PreToolUse hot path. Plus anticipation (trajectory-resemblance warnings) and counterfactual
  (`what breaks if I change X?` from an induced causal graph).
- **12-tool MCP server** (was 9): added `memory_why`, `memory_guard_feedback`, and
  `memory_anticipate_feedback`, so MCP-only agents (Cursor, Cline, Zed, Claude Desktop) can train
  guards, not only read them.
- **Cross-machine sync that merges.** A structured git merge driver auto-resolves concurrent edits
  to the same note (recurrence takes the max, a retirement wins, tags union) and leaves honest
  conflict markers on a genuine divergence. Verified end to end through real git.
- **Self-contained HTML dashboard** (`python -m nevertwice.dashboard`): the whole store rendered
  into one offline file, no server.
- A comparison row and honest write-up for the Hindsight memory system.

### Changed
- README leads with the moat (plain files you own, plus memory that acts) and the measured
  guard result, with the token-economy number kept in context rather than as a headline.
- Repo layout: tests and the research harnesses moved out of the shipped package, so a
  `pip install` gets runtime code only.
- CI runs the product suite on Python 3.10-3.14 across Linux, macOS, and Windows; the research
  harnesses run on a current Python.

### Fixed
- Two critical merge-driver bugs (a non-existent module path in the driver registration, and a
  conflict that could silently drop one side on rebase) plus ~20 correctness and hardening fixes
  from two adversarial review rounds and a five-advisor council review.
- Secret redaction now also covers the embeddings-cache and cloud-embedder path.
- A regex character class that emitted a Python 3.14 `FutureWarning` and had stopped stripping
  en/em dashes.
- All 162 open code-scanning alerts resolved (real fixes; a few documented policy exclusions).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06

### Added
- Opt-in **Brain layer** (`NEVERTWICE_PROFILE=research` or `general`): the same captured sessions
  self-wire into a knowledge graph of typed entities (paper, method, dataset, ...) with per-entity
  cards, an evolution timeline, and graph-centrality salience. Pull-only, so the token-bounded hot
  path is byte-for-byte unchanged when it is off (the default).
- A SQLite scale-tier keeps entity queries single-digit-millisecond into thousands of notes.

### Invariants (enforced by tests)
- Hot-path injection is byte-for-byte unchanged with the Brain layer off.
- Brain notes are pull-only, never in the default injection set.
- `LOCAL_ONLY` projects and agents never reach the cloud.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06

Initial public release: local-first, agent-agnostic long-term memory as plain Markdown under git.
Hybrid retrieval (local `bge-m3` embeddings fused with BM25, calibrated abstention), write-time
supersession so contradictions do not pile up, capture for Claude Code (hooks) and any agent
(MCP / watch daemon / Python API / LangChain / LlamaIndex). On LongMemEval-oracle with one shared
local embedder, calibrated fusion reached R@5 0.80 against Mem0 0.76, with the harness and the
negative results published.
