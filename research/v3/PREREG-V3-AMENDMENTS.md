# PREREG-V3 amendments

Revision 1 of PREREG-V3 (research/v3/PREREG-V3-rev1.md) is frozen: the A3 freeze fragment records its sha256, and it
is never rewritten. An amendment found after it lives here, beside it (the auditor's Q-C5e-3, 2026-09-28). Each one
carries its id, its trap number, its date, the ruling that made it, its reason in one line, and the amended text word
for word. FREEZE-V3 (A10) pins revision 1 and this file together, by the sha256 of each, and E5 lists every amendment.

## A1 - T31: graphiti with its `[falkordb]` extra

- **Trap:** T31 graphiti's FalkorDB client.
- **Date:** 2026-09-28.
- **Ruling:** the auditor's Q-C5e-2 (2026-09-28, 11:13), found as B-GRAPHITI-EXTRA before any window.
- **Reason:** graphiti with its [falkordb] extra: the client its FalkorDB driver imports (arm_graphiti.py:162),
  vendor-documented; without it the arm cannot start.
- **§2.2, the zep-graphiti row, amended** (revision 1's row plus exactly the text `with `[falkordb]` (T31); `):

| zep-graphiti | product | graphiti-core, latest stable at freeze (0.30.2 read 2026-09-26); with `[falkordb]` (T31); FalkorDB image by digest | 3.12, fresh venv graphiti_v3 | vendor-recommended:https://github.com/getzep/graphiti | to install, to adapt |

- **§13, trap closure, the new line:**

| T31 graphiti's FalkorDB client | §2.2 | `[falkordb]`; the client and its driver imported and version-checked at install |
